How do I approach designing software?

First I would figure out what my software intent is. try to understand the user base. Get feedback from users to gather what needs the software should meet. Create an software design document that will detail the plan for the developement of the software. Create a prototype software. Conduct testing of software. Once it is to satifaction and the design requirements then deploy the software and maintain it with support and updates as nessesary. 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

This project has taught me how to design software in a methodical approach. Taught me how to better create code in small portions and test to make sure each section works as intended to minimize mistakes and redundant code.

What design process did you follow for your project work?

The design process I followed was to focus on one feature at a time. Throughtout this process I found it beneficial to focus on the Shaped process first creating one complex shaped until i achieved my desired look. Then I was able to move on to texturing and playing around with the different textures and seeing how each texture affected the final look. once that was to my satisfacion, I moved on to lighting. However, this section proved to be the most difficult for me and which I did not sicessfully complete however, it gave me a starting point to continue to work through the issue and hopefully find a solution to add lighting to my scene. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I could apply these tactics to my future design approach to keep me organized and on tract to deliver a sucessful opperating application within the deadlines set.

How do I approach developing programs?

I would approach this the same way I would approach making software, with a design plan and feed back from users. 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene 

New startegies I used while developing my 3d scene was to use Modular Design. My creating the individual elements I was able to make it easier for myself to update each individual elements so it would negatively affect the rest of my code. I wouldnt say this is a new strategy however comments each individual elements helped me to organize and create better code quality.

How did iteration factor into your development?

By introduces the new features of my scene Incrementally this helped to create a stable code and it can help me to focus on future improvements.  Adding final details after the code was tested and worked it allowed me to enhance my scene.


How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

The approach I took to develope the code throught these milestones evolved due to understanding the assignements and refining the code as I went through each milestone enhancing the 3D scene. The features of each milestone brought my scene togther to create a realistic scene. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer Science can help me in reaching my goals by giving me the foundational knowledge to advance in my cuurent career and to build on everything that I have learned through experience. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational Graphics and visualizations give me knowledge and skills that can enhance my problem solving. because computational graphics require to work in iteration and break down sections of code at a time this helps me gain strong analytical skills. It has taught me to appreciate collabration within teams and has opened me up to considering alternative career paths since computational graphics can be used in a number of other fields.
